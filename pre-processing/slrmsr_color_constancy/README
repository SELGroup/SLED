========================================


Smart Light Random Memory Sprays Retinex is an image enhancing program  
local brightness adjustment and color correction. It is relatively fast
and it produces images of high quality. It is based on the Light Random
Sprays Retinex algorithm, but many of its flaws and weaknesses are fixed.
The program is based on the paper mentioned in the Literature section.

The program needs OpenCV library for image reading and simple 
processing. For compilation on Linux, the program also needs pkg-config.
